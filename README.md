CipherTimeComparisons
======
Benchmarking encrypt/decrypt times of algorithms in the Cryptography library

Easy MP4 Usage
------
+ Install the Python Cryptography library 
```
$ pip3 install cryptography
```
+ Place a file named "test.mp4" in the root dir 
+ run ciphertest.py
```
$ Python3 ciphertest.py
```


Other files
------
+ Install the Python Cryptography library 
```
$ pip3 install cryptography
```
+ run ciphertest.py with your filename 
+ select your cipher 
```
$ python3 ciphertest.py testfile.txt

 Which Cipher?
 (1) AES
 (2) FERNET
 (3) XOR
